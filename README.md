## About the Shopping List App
This app provides a basic shopping list built with Laravel and Vue.js using Inertia.js
When seeding the database as described in [setup](#setup), 2 test users are created each with 10 items in their shopping list
A diff of all code changes to the default Laravel and Inertia with Vue install can be seen [here](https://github.com/refugene/laravel-vue-shopping-list/pull/1)

A logged in user can:
- add a new item with a price to their shopping list
- delete an item from their shopping list
- Mark each item as 'bought' and also toggle this back by clicking 'undo' 
- Reorder items by dragging and dropping them in the list
- See a total cost of the shopping list
- See a warning if the total cost of the shopping list exceeds Â£100
